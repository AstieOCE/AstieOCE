# Hi there, I'm [AstieOCE](https://github.com/AstieOCE) 👋👋👋

## About Me
- 👨‍💻 I'm a passionate developer with a disgusting level of interest with code - but never truly dedicated myself to the lifestyle.
- 🌱 Currently learning C#.
- 🎯 2023 Goals: Grow my C# Skills above and beyond what I have previously reached with the other languages I know.
- 🤝 Open to collaborate on interesting projects. To be honest, I usually just gamify everything for myself - Very ADHD sadly.

## Recent Projects

Rimworld Modding Projects. Unfortunately, I don't understand how to mod the game properly. Like I remember modding java
minecraft being easier (when I was like 12 lmao). So it's taking me abit not gonna lie.

For now, I am a quiet lil' bee..!
If I end up helping you, I'm honestly glad. Whether it's through code, comments or documentation - I just hope it helps.
I like to simplify things over and over, it's honestly a permanent cycle aha.
